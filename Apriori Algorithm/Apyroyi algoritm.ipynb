Choosing an appropriate min_support value is crucial for tailoring the mining process to specific analysis goals.\n"

It indicates the conditional probability that the presence of the antecedent (if-part) in a transaction implies the presence of the consequent (then-part). A higher confidence value, expressed as a percentage, signifies a stronger association between the items. For instance, a confidence of 80% implies that, in 80% of transactions where the antecedent is present, the consequent is also present, making the rule more dependable for decision-making in areas like marketing or recommendation systems.\n",

    "• <u>How does adjusting the min_threshold parameter affect the generated association rules?</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the min_threshold parameter in rule generation impacts the selection criteria for rules to be considered interesting. A higher min_threshold filters out rules with lower confidence, generating a more reliable set of rules but potentially reducing their quantity. Conversely, a lower min_threshold includes rules with lower confidence, resulting in a larger set of rules that may include weaker associations. The parameter thus serves as a control mechanism, allowing users to fine-tune the trade-off between rule quality and quantity based on the specific requirements of the analysis or application domain."
